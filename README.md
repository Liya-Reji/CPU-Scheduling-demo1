CPU Scheduling Demo
This repository contains a demonstration of classic CPU scheduling algorithms. The project uses a mix of programming languages and web technologies to provide both code implementations and interactive visualizations.

 About Scheduling Algorithms
FCFS (First-Come, First-Served): A non-preemptive algorithm that executes processes in the order they arrive.

SJF (Shortest Job First): A non-preemptive algorithm that prioritizes the process with the smallest burst time.

Round Robin: A preemptive algorithm that assigns a fixed time quantum to each process, allowing for fair CPU time distribution.
