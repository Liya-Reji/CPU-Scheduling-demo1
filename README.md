## Algorithms Explained

### FCFS (First-Come-First-Served)
Non-preemptive scheduling where processes are executed in the order of their arrival.

### SJF (Shortest Job First)
Schedules processes with the smallest burst time first, minimizing average waiting time.

### Round Robin
Preemptive scheduling where each process gets a fixed time unit (quantum) in cyclic order.
